# [Pause-other-audios browser extension](https://github.com/FarisHijazi/pause-other-audios-browser-extension)

A browser extension to pause any other audio element once you click on a new one.

Tired of waiting for the previous audio to finish playing until you can play the next one?

No more overlapping audios!
